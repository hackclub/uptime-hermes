## Uptime hermes 
_named hermes because this bot correctly routes it to the correct teams_

Uptime hermes is a bot which is handling hackclub's uptime kuma notification and routing certain things to certain teams!

## How to use
Well since this is apart of hackclub infra you will have to add yourself to the src/admins.ts
if you are already an admin you will be able to open the app home and create/manage trackers and teams.
For this app you need to make a team which whoever you add to the team will be notified, once you have a team you can create a tracker and then in dm's you will get a url which you can use to setup with the hackclub uptime kuma :)
